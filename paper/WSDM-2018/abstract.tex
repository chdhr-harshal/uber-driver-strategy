\begin{abstract}
On-demand ridesharing platforms like Uber and Lyft play an important role in urban transportation, 
  enabling car owners to become drivers for hire with minimal overhead.
One natural optimization problem in this domain has focused on optimal route planning of a deployed
  fleet of vehicles, with objective functions geared largely towards improving the overall service 
  to passengers or minimizing total resource utilization (fuel consumption, miles driven, etc.).
But much less emphasis has been placed on optimization for individual drivers.
While some individuals drive opportunistically either as their schedule allows or on a fixed 
  schedule, strategic behavior regarding when and where to drive can substantially increase
  driver income.
To address this issue, we model the passenger seeking behavior of the

The parameters of this MDP are set using Uber Rider API and publicly available New York Taxi datasets. Using this model, we devise three optimal in expectation strategies for drivers and evaluate them. Furthermore, we provide a sensitivity analysis of these strategies to account for uncertainties in the MDP parameters.
Our main finding is XXX.
