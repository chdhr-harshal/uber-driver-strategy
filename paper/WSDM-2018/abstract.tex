\begin{abstract}
On demand ride services like Uber, Lyft, etc. play an important role in urban transportation. Strategic behavior on such platforms can help solve important societal problem like raising the income of taxi drivers. Current research has largely focused on optimal route planning of the taxi vehicles, however such routing policies, while improving the overall service to passengers, are not optimal for driver revenues over extended periods of time. To address this issue, we model the passenger seeking behavior of the taxi drivers on Uber as a controlled Markov Decision Process (MDP) over a finite horizon of time. The parameters of this MDP are set using Uber Rider API and publicly available New York Taxi datasets. Using this model, we devise three optimal in expectation strategies for drivers and evaluate them. Furthermore, we provide a sensitivity analysis of these strategies to account for uncertainties in the MDP parameters.
