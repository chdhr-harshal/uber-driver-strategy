\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The proliferation of on-demand ridesharing platforms like Lyft and Uber
have changed the way people move within urban environments. 



Clearly, ridesharing platforms create a supply-and-demand environment that offers 
plenty opportunities for academic research that focuses on pricing mechanisms
as well as algorithms for matching drivers to customers~\cite{}.
At the same time, data-analytic studies have focused
on studying drivers' behavior and their motivation as it comes from the flexible working 
hours~\cite{hall2016analysis} as well as the surge pricing mechanisms of the platforms themselves~\cite{chen2015peeking,chen2016dynamic}.
