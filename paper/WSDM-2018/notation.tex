\section*{Notation}
\label{sec:notation}

Vectors are denoted with lowercase bold letters (e.g., $\vec{a} = [a_i]$) and matrices are denoted with uppercase bold letters (e.g., $\matr{A} = [a_{ij}]$). The notation $\vec{1}$ refers to the vector of ones, with size dependent on the context. The short form notation $\vec{a_i}$ refers to the $i$-th row vector of the matrix $\matr{A}$. Calligraphic letters (e.g., $\mathcal{A}$) are used to denote a set of elements. Let $\Theta_n$ be a set of $n \times n$ transition matrices (non-negative matrices with rows that summing to one). A probability simplex in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is denoted by $\Delta_n = \{\vec{p} \in \mathbb{R}^n_+ : \transpose{p} \vec{1} = 1 \}$.
